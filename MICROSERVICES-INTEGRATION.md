## âš¡ Quick Setup & Launch

### Option 1: One-Command Launch
```bash
# Install all dependencies and run all services
./run-all-services.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup (3 Terminals)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Main Trading Platform (already running)
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Mining Control Center
cd mining-control
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 3 - Social Justice Platform
cd social-token-platform
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Step-by-Step Setup
```bash
# First, set up all dependencies
./setup-microservices.sh

# Then run with concurrently
npx concurrently \
  "npm run dev" \
  "cd mining-control && npm run dev" \
  "cd social-token-platform && npm run dev"
```

## ðŸ”— Integration Features

### Real-Time Data Flow
- **Mining â†’ Main Platform**: Mining revenue data flows to the main dashboard
- **Mining â†’ Social Platform**: Mining profits automatically fund social projects
- **All Services**: Real-time WebSocket updates across all platforms

### Cross-Service Communication
```javascript
// Mining revenue automatically funds social projects
POST /api/mining/allocation
{
  "dailyProfit": 500,
  "allocationPercentage": 30  // 30% goes to social projects
}

// Main platform displays mining and social data
GET /api/mining/operations    // Mining rig status
GET /api/social/projects      // Social impact projects
```

### Unified Dashboard
Your main platform now includes:
- **Mining Operations Section**: Live rig monitoring with revenue tracking
- **Social Impact Section**: Project progress and token allocation
- **Cross-Service Buttons**: Quick access to specialized interfaces

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Integration

All services maintain your cosmic theme:
- **Space-themed colors**: Cosmic gold, cyber blue, neon green
- **Futuristic typography**: Orbitron and Rajdhani fonts
- **Animated elements**: Glowing buttons, hover effects, live data updates
- **Consistent UI**: Same card styles and cosmic gradients across all platforms

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

### Mining Control Center
- Real-time hashrate monitoring
- Temperature and power consumption tracking  
- Profitability calculations
- Remote rig control (restart, shutdown, start)

### Social Justice Platform
- Community project management
- Token allocation tracking
- Impact metrics (people helped, communities reached)
- Funding progress monitoring

### Main Trading Platform
- Aggregated data from all services
- Unified portfolio view including mining revenue
- Social impact funding allocation from trading profits

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### WebSocket Connections
```javascript
// Each service has its own WebSocket endpoint
Main Platform:    ws://localhost:3000/ws
Mining Control:   ws://localhost:3001/mining-ws  
Social Platform:  ws://localhost:3002/social-ws
```

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Main Platform APIs (existing)
GET /api/market/ohlc
GET /api/bot/status
GET /api/trades

# Mining Operations (new)
GET /api/mining/operations
GET /api/operations/summary

# Social Impact (new)  
GET /api/social/projects
GET /api/social/token-metrics
POST /api/mining/allocation
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

### Development (Current Setup)
All services run locally on different ports with hot reloading.

### Production Options
1. **Single Server**: Deploy all services on one machine with reverse proxy
2. **Container Deployment**: Docker containers for each service
3. **Cloud Microservices**: Deploy each service to separate cloud instances
4. **Replit Deployment**: Use Replit's multi-service deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Launch All Services**: Use the setup scripts to get everything running
2. **Test Integration**: Check data flow between services
3. **Customize Settings**: Adjust mining allocation percentages
4. **Add More Features**: Expand with additional microservices as needed

## ðŸ”¥ Benefits Achieved

âœ… **Scalable Architecture**: Each service can scale independently  
âœ… **Fault Tolerance**: If one service fails, others continue running  
âœ… **Technology Flexibility**: Use different frameworks per service  
âœ… **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different services  
âœ… **Resource Management**: Optimize resources per service type  
âœ… **Easy Maintenance**: Update services independently
